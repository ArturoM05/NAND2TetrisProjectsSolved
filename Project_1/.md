# Nand2tetris Project 1 Solved

## Explanation of the topic 
Before you read the solution of this project it's important have an idea of what are we doing and why are we doing it, so I recommend read [Lecture 1](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MY1buFHo_Wx5DPrKhCNSA2cm5ltwFJzM/view).

In case You don't want to read it, this is an small summary:

### Basic Concepts

Boolean Values: Basically They're values that can only have two possible states, for examples: true/false, on/off, yes/no and 1/0

if we have one boolean variable we have 2 posible states but if we add more variables the posible states increases following this pattern 2^n where n is the number of boolean variables, for example 
if we have 4 variables, we woud have 2^4 (16) posible states.

Bolean functions: Similar to an usual math function, given a number of boolean values we return a boolean value.

Truth Table: This is a tool to represent how an boolean function/expression works, for example:
This is the truth table of the function AND that if we see as true and false, only return true when both variables are true 
| a | b | out |  
|-- | --|:---:|
| 0 | 0 |  0  |
| 0 | 1 |  0  |
| 1 | 0 |  0  |
| 1 | 1 |  1  |
 
>  the order of the values is given by the numeric in the binary system, that is, in this case we count from 0 to 3 in binary. Watch this video if you are curious about [

### the power of Nand 
Nand is a boolean function that return the same of AND but denied
that mean if we deny the output of a Nand function we get an usual AND function, the same way using logic and boolean algebra we can realize every elementary bolean function (NOT, AND, OR).

We can build any function with the basic ones so if we can build any elementary function with a NAND. Basically we can build any function only with nand functions.

### Logic gates
As we said at the beginning, all values that can have two states can be represented as Boolean values. This also applies to electronics where we have two possible states 0 (low voltage 0-1v ) and 1 (high voltage 5v) therefore we can build the so-called logic gates that allow us to perform the Boolean functions seen before.

### Building a CHIP: Hardware description languages (HDL)
To build CHIPs we are going to use a programming language with a syntax similar to the one in Java called HDL and we will use the [Nand2Tetris Online IDE](https://nand2tetris.github.io/web-ide/chip) to simulate CHIPS.

for each CHIP we have. we have its visual representation for example the CHIP XOR with the following visual representation and truth table:
