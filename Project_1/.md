# Nand2tetris Project 1 Solved

## Explanation of the topic 
Before you read the solution of this project it's important have an idea of what and why are we doing, so I recommend read [Lecture 1](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MY1buFHo_Wx5DPrKhCNSA2cm5ltwFJzM/view).

In case You don't want to read it, this is an small summary:

### Basic Concepts

Boolean Values: Basically They're values that can only have two possible states, for examples: true/false, on/off, yes/no and 1/0

if we have one boolean variable we have 2 posible states but if we add more variables the posible states increases following this pattern 2^n where n is the number of boolean variables, for example 
if we have 4 variables, we woud have 2^4 (16) posible states.

Bolean functions: Similar to an usual math function, given a number of boolean values we return a boolean value.

Truth Table: This is a tool to represent how an boolean function/expression works, for example:
This is the truth table of the function AND that if we see as true and false, only return true when both variables are true 
| a | b | out |  
|-- | --|:---:|
| 0 | 0 |  0  |
| 0 | 1 |  0  |
| 1 | 0 |  0  |
| 1 | 1 |  1  |
 
>  the order of the values is given by the numeric in the binary system, that is, in this case we count from 0 to 3 in binary. Watch this video if you are curious about [
